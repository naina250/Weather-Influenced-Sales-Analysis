# Weather-Influenced-Sales-Analysis
This is a data analysis project where I explored how **weather conditions affect sales** at a coffee shop using Python.

## What I Did
- Combined sales data with weather data
- Analyzed how temperature and conditions impact sales
- Found top-performing products and locations
- Studied sales patterns by weekday and weather

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn

## Key Insights
- Sales are higher on warm days 
- Coffee and tea sell most on rainy/cloudy days 
- Hellâ€™s Kitchen store performs the best 
- Weekdays have higher sales than weekends
